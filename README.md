# Non-Volatile Memory Emulator

(Project done in Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science (ICT, CAS) around 2016. It is *not* maintained anymore. Happy to know one group in HUST has extended this emulator and used it in their research.)

The basic idea is to use Intel PMU to count number of read/writes requests issued from CPU to Memory. Based on this, the emulator manually inject delays to the CPU by running an idle function to emulate the extra read/write latency of NVM. The bandwidth is emulated by limiting the memory controller requests. The whole emulation model is similar to what [Quartz]( http://www.jahrhundert.net/papers/middleware2015.pdf) is doing.

For anyone who interested in this project:  
This emulator is much more complex that it shoud be. We SHOULD leverage the PMU facility already provided by linux kernel. I saw kernel-events improved a lot during These 2 or 3 years. Previously all x86-pmu-events code is in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/, now they have a standalone directory in arch/x86/events/.  

Anyway, let us see when toothpaste company Intel will have PM ready for markets.
